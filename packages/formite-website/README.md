# Website

The Formite website is built using Docusaurus 2, a modern static website generator.

### Local Development

From the root of the monorepo:

```
$ yarn start-website
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build-website
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
